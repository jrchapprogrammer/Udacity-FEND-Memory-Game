## Instructions

To play, [click here](https://jrchapprogrammer.github.io/Udacity-FEND-Memory-Game/). The game will start upon loading.

## Gameplay

Click on tiles to reveal them. If the two corresponding tiles match, they will change color and stay open. If not, they will both close, allowing you to make another selection. The goal is to match all tiles. As you play, a timer will keep track of how long you've been playing. A rating system (stars) will track the number of moves you make. If you take too many moves, you lose a star. At any time, you can reset the game with the **restart** icon on the top right side. When all tiles are matched, your rating and time will be displayed. Click the **'Play Again'** button if you'd like to play again.
